// Renders the sign-in screen to static HTML and asserts the things that break
// silently: the institute identity actually appearing, the error states staying
// calm and distinct, and the generated pattern being stable.
//
// It also asserts the ABSENCE of the visual clichés the redesign was asked to
// avoid. Those are the parts most likely to creep back in during a later edit
// — someone adds a shadow, someone reaches for indigo — and they are cheap to
// catch mechanically.
//
// Run: see RUNBOOK.md → Running the automated tests.
