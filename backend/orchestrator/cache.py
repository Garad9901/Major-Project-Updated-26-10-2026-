"""Semantic response cache.

WHY THIS IS THE HIGHEST-VALUE OPTIMISATION AVAILABLE ON CPU
A cache hit skips the entire pipeline — router, SQL generation, retrieval,
synthesis and verification — so it turns a ~13s answer (warm) into a ~0.05s one.
Unlike batching or a faster serving layer, it does not need hardware that isn't
there: it removes the work instead of speeding it up.

For a management dashboard this matters more than it looks. Fifty people asking
about the same handful of departments at the start of a meeting produce mostly
DUPLICATE questions, phrased differently. Exact-match caching would miss almost
all of them; embedding similarity catches them.

TWO-TIER LOOKUP, AND WHY THE ORDER MATTERS
  1. exact  — a dict keyed on the normalised question. Costs nothing.
  2. semantic — cosine similarity against recent question embeddings.

The exact tier exists because the semantic tier is NOT free: it needs the
question embedded first, which is a model call. Warm that is ~0.04s, but on a
cold model it was measured at 5.02s — so checking exact-first means a repeated
question never pays an embedding at all.

CORRECTNESS: WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* CACHED
  * errors, refusals, and degraded answers — caching "the database is down"
    would keep serving that after it came back.
  * empty answers.

STALENESS, AND WHY INVALIDATION CANNOT BE A FUNCTION CALL
The entries live in THIS PROCESS. `manage.py` runs in a different one, so a
management command that calls invalidate() clears its own empty cache, reports
success, and leaves the serving worker untouched. Measured on the running stack:

    ask #1 (cold)                                60 s
    a separate process reports                    0 entries
    ask #2                                        1 s   <- worker HAS it cached
    invalidate() from a separate process   "cleared 0 entries"
    ask #3                                        0 s   <- still served stale

That is why invalidation goes through a GENERATION TOKEN in Redis instead. Any
process can bump it; every serving process notices on its next lookup and drops
everything. It costs one Redis read per lookup, which is sub-millisecond against
a ~28 s answer, and it keeps working unchanged if this ever runs on more than
one worker.

WHY THIS MATTERS MORE THAN A CACHE USUALLY DOES: answers are matched
SEMANTICALLY, so a rephrased question hits the same entry. Correct a fee or a
deadline in the records and, without invalidation, students keep being told the
old figure for up to RESPONSE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS — by a system whose whole claim
is that it answers from the records.

IF REDIS IS UNREACHABLE the cache FAILS CLOSED: it stops serving and stops
storing, rather than serving answers it cannot prove are current. This costs
nothing in practice, because sessions live in Redis too — if Redis is down,
nobody is signed in to be served a stale answer.

THRESHOLD
0.95 cosine, as specified. That is deliberately strict. "How many faculty in
Medicine?" and "How many faculty in Engineering?" are lexically almost identical
and embed very close together — a loose threshold would answer one with the
other's number. See _SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD for the measured separation.
