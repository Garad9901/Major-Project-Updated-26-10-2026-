"""Chat history: conversations and the messages inside them.

WHY THIS IS NOT THE AUDIT LOG
audit.AuditLog already records every question and answer, so it looks like it
could back the sidebar. It must not. The two have opposite requirements:

  audit log      a compliance record. Append-only, covers EVERY user, purged on
                 a fixed retention schedule (AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS), and read
                 by whoever is responsible for oversight.
  chat history   a convenience feature. Owned by one user, who reasonably
                 expects to delete a conversation — and deleting it must NOT
                 erase the audit trail.

Backing the UI with the audit log would mean either letting users delete audit
records, or purging their chat history after 90 days because a governance
setting said so. Both are wrong, so these are separate tables.

class QueryProfile(models.Model):
    """Per-stage latency for one answered question.

    WHY THIS IS A TABLE AND NOT JUST A LOG LINE
    orchestrator/profiling.py has logged a PROFILE line per question for a
    while. That is enough to inspect one request and useless for the question
    that actually matters — "where does the time go across the last hundred
    real questions?" — because answering it from logs means the logs must still
    exist, must not have rotated, must cover a representative period, and must
    be parsed with a regex that breaks whenever the log line changes.

    A row per question makes the p50/p95/p99 a query. It also means the data
    survives a container restart, which the previous approach did not: the
    profile rode along on the SSE `done` event and was then discarded, so every
    latency claim had to be backed by a fresh benchmark run rather than by what
    users had actually experienced.

    WHY NOT EXTEND AuditLog
    AuditLog already stores `latency_ms` and it was tempting to add six more
    columns there. It is a compliance record with its own retention rule
    (AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS), and performance data has neither the same
    sensitivity nor the same lifetime — it holds no answer text and can be
    truncated freely. Same reasoning as Conversation vs AuditLog above.

    THE DENORMALISED COLUMNS ARE DELIBERATE
    `stages` holds the full profile as JSON and is the source of truth. The
    individual *_ms columns duplicate values already inside it, so that the
    common aggregations are plain SQL rather than a JSON traversal per row.
