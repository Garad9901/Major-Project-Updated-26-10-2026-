"""The decision about an unavailable lookup is taken away from the LLM.

THE HISTORY THESE TESTS LOCK DOWN
With Postgres stopped, the synthesis model wrote:

    "The college records do not cover the total number of faculty holding the
     Lecturer rank"

against a table holding 3,053 of them. A confident, specific negative, caused
by an outage — the failure shape the original production audit called the worst
this system has.

Three prompt-level attempts failed to stop it: the wording in
synthesis_agent/untrusted.py, routing the outage through that wording via
_UnavailableSql, and an explicit "never write this, write that instead"
template in the synthesis system prompt. The model kept its own template.

A fourth attempt was not made. The model is now either not called at all, or
called only for the retrieval half and never shown the note.

WHY THESE ASSERTIONS ARE PROGRAMMATIC
The failure only becomes visible when a person reads an answer during an
outage, which is the least likely moment for anyone to be reading carefully. A
test that has to be eyeballed is not a test of this.

Kept in a separate module from tests.py because it is about one specific
regression and reads better as a unit than as another class appended to a file
that is mostly about conversations.
