"""Tests for untrusted-content fencing.

These are deterministic string tests, not model tests. That distinction matters:
they verify the property we can actually GUARANTEE — that untrusted text cannot
escape the fence or impersonate the fence markers — rather than the property we
can only encourage, which is that the model declines to obey an instruction it
can plainly see.

A model's refusal cannot be asserted in a unit test without making the suite
depend on a running Ollama and on the model behaving identically every run. The
end-to-end behavioural check is a manual step; see the Phase 6 notes.
