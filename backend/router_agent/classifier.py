    tier. `previous_route` is what the last question in this conversation
    resolved to, and is used as the fallback for a follow-up the tiers cannot
    classify — see the note at the bottom of this function.

    THREE TIERS, and the LLM is the last one — see router_agent/fast_router.py.
    Measured before this change: the LLM router cost 5.2-9.1s warm (and 60s
    cold) to emit about twenty tokens of JSON, because the prompt it reads is
    ~1,200 tokens of worked examples and it was reading them with a 7B model.
    The first two tiers answer the overwhelming majority of questions in
    microseconds or tens of milliseconds.

    A misroute is cheap and recoverable: it yields a worse answer, never an
    unsafe one. Routing grants no capability — the SQL guard, the table
    allowlist and the read-only role are all downstream of this and unaffected
    by what it returns.
