"""Resolves LOGICAL entity names to the college database's PHYSICAL names.

The migration's central design decision. Every reference to a college table
goes through here, so that adapting to the real college schema is editing
config/schema_map.json and re-running the suite — not auditing 15k lines for
string literals.

WHY A LOADER RATHER THAN A CONSTANT
The map is data, and it is read at import time into module-level constants
because the SQL agent's allowlist is one of its consumers. An allowlist that
could change under a running process is an allowlist with a race in it, so this
resolves once, at startup, and a bad map fails the process rather than degrading
to something permissive.

FAIL CLOSED, LOUDLY
A missing, malformed, or empty map raises. It does NOT fall back to a built-in
default list. That is deliberate and is the lesson of two defects found in this
codebase in the last week — the SQL guard's table allowlist and the identity
cache both treated "nothing found" as "nothing to enforce". A schema map that
silently degraded to an empty allowlist would either break every question or,
worse, be combined with some other default and widen what the model can read.

The one thing this module must never do is return a plausible answer when it
does not know the real one.
