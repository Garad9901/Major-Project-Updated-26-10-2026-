"""The SQL guard, exercised under BOTH dialects it must survive.

WHY BOTH, AND WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM tests.py

The guard is the security boundary between a language model's output and the
college's database, and `DIALECT` decides which grammar it validates against.
Porting it to T-SQL is therefore not a formatting change: a case that a Postgres
parser rejects as a syntax error may be perfectly valid T-SQL, and the whole
point of the existing OPENROWSET/OPENQUERY denials was the dialect they become
live in. So every case runs twice, once per dialect, and the reason a case is
rejected has to hold in both.

THE ALLOW CASES ARE NOT FILLER. A guard that rejects legitimate questions gets
relaxed by whoever is on call next, and the relaxation will not be as careful as
the original. Real joins, subqueries, aggregates and ordering must keep working,
and that is asserted here alongside the refusals.

TWO DEFECTS THIS FILE PINS, both found by probing rather than by reading:

  1. FOUR-PART NAMES BYPASSED THE TABLE ALLOWLIST. `t.name` is only the final
     component of an identifier, so

         SELECT * FROM linked_evil.master.dbo.faculty

     reduced to the allowlisted name `faculty` while pointing at a LINKED
     SERVER. Measured as PASSING the allowlist before the fix. Harmless under
     Postgres, where a cross-database name fails at execution; live under T-SQL.
     Identical in shape to ca69849 — an identifier check that inspected only
     part of the identifier.

  2. xp_cmdshell IN A PROJECTION WAS NOT SEEN. As a FROM source it is already
     caught by the allowlist, but

         SELECT xp_cmdshell('whoami') FROM courses

     is a Select over an allowlisted table with the call in the select list,
     where no table check reaches it. The read-only principal DENYs EXECUTE, so
     this was defence in depth — but "the database would have refused it" is
     exactly the reasoning that made the OPENROWSET hole look harmless.
