# CONNECTION POOL — and why it is NOT about latency
# ==============================================================================
# Profiling this pipeline showed connecting costs 0.01s and executing an agent
# query 0.00s. The database is nowhere near the bottleneck, so pooling buys no
# measurable speed. It is here for a different reason: a HARD CEILING.
#
#     rag_agent_ro has CONNECTION LIMIT 10   (set by setup_readonly_role)
#
# and answering ONE question opened TWO fresh connections — one to introspect
# the schema for the prompt, one to run the generated query. Under real
# concurrency that is 2xN connections against a limit of 10, so past about five
# simultaneous questions Postgres refuses with "too many connections for role".
# The failure mode is errors, not slowness — which is why the profile did not
# reveal it and a load test does.
#
# SIZING: the limit of 10 is SHARED with the sync worker, which holds one
# connection continuously. A max of 8 leaves that plus a spare for an operator
# running check_rag_agent_ro. If you raise this, raise the role's CONNECTION
# LIMIT first or you have simply moved where the error happens.

#
# The fast path borrows one pooled connection per request. With 24 worker
# threads a pool of 8 means 16 concurrent fast-path questions get
# DatabaseUnavailable and fall through to the model — turning a 200 ms answer
# into a 60 s one, or a refusal, under exactly the load this is meant to serve.
#
# Sized to the thread count so the pool can never be the thing that runs out
# first. The role's CONNECTION LIMIT was raised to 32 in the same commit to
# cover this pool plus the sync worker plus operator headroom.
