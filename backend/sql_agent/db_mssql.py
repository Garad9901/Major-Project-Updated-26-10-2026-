"""The college's SQL Server, read-only, pooled. The T-SQL sibling of db.py.

A SEPARATE MODULE rather than branches threaded through db.py. The Postgres path
is the calibration baseline for every measurement in docs/ and stays the only
tested path until the port is proven, so it is left byte-for-byte alone; db.py
dispatches to this module when SQL_DIALECT=tsql. When the migration completes
and Postgres is no longer the college store, this replaces it rather than
merging into it.

WHY THE POOL EXISTS HERE — and how the reason differs from Postgres

db.py's pool is NOT about latency. Profiling put connecting at 0.01s against a
~28s answer. It exists because rag_agent_ro has CONNECTION LIMIT 10 and one
question opened TWO connections (schema introspection, then the query), so past
about five simultaneous questions Postgres refused outright.

SQL Server has no per-login connection limit by default, so that specific
ceiling does not transfer. The pool is kept anyway for the other half of the
reason: it BOUNDS how many connections one busy moment can open against a server
this system does not own. On the college's production database, "the assistant
opened ninety connections" is their incident, not ours, and we would have caused
it. A bound we chose is better than a limit they discover.

pyodbc does its own driver-manager pooling, which is not the same thing: it
reuses connections but does not cap how many exist. The explicit bound is the
point.

# TLS. READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING IT.

# ODBC Driver 18 defaults to Encrypt=yes AND validates the server certificate.
# A development SQL Server has a self-signed certificate, so the connection
# fails, and every search result offers the same fix:
#
#     TrustServerCertificate=yes
#
# That works locally and is a genuine vulnerability in production: it disables
# certificate validation on the connection carrying every student record across
# the college network, so anything in path can present any certificate and read
# or alter the traffic. Nothing complains, because from the application's point
# of view it is working.
#
# It is the same shape as the HSTS defect found in this project: a setting whose
# local convenience is indistinguishable from its production weakness.
#
# So it is allowed ONLY outside production, and config/secret_guards.py refuses
# to boot production with it set — the same mechanism that refuses default
# passwords, for the same reason: a credential-grade misconfiguration should
# stop the process, not produce a log line nobody reads.
#
# The real deployment answer is to trust the college server's certificate
# properly. That is a Phase 7 runbook item and the DBA has to supply it.
