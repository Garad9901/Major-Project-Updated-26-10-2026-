# THE DRIVER'S OWN "the connection died" EXCEPTIONS, FOR BOTH BACKENDS.
#
# This module caught psycopg2.OperationalError by name. pyodbc raises a
# DIFFERENT type for the same condition, so on the T-SQL path the exception
# would have escaped this handler, missed the DatabaseUnavailable wrapping the
# orchestrator degrades on, and surfaced as an unhandled 500.
#
# The path only runs when the database is ALREADY DOWN, which is the worst
# possible time to discover it and the reason it would not have been noticed:
# every test and every healthy request skips it.
#
# The pyodbc class was OBSERVED, not inferred. Against a genuinely stopped SQL
# Server container:
#
#     class    : OperationalError
#     mro      : OperationalError -> DatabaseError -> Error -> Exception
#     sqlstate : HYT00  ("Login timeout expired")
#
# Both are listed unconditionally rather than switched on the active dialect:
# the tuple costs nothing, and a handler that is correct only when a second
# variable is set correctly is a handler with a way to be wrong.
