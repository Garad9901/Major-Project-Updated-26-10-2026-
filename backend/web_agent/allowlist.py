"""The fixed set of URLs this system may fetch, and how one is chosen.

THE CENTRAL RULE
The language model never supplies a URL. It is not asked to. It cannot be
prompted into asking for one, because nothing in this module accepts a URL as
input — selection happens by deterministic keyword matching against `topics` in
the `web_sources` section of config/institution.json.

That is a deliberate design choice rather than a filter. A "generate a URL, then
validate it" design is only as good as the validator, and a validator that must
reason about URL parsing (userinfo, IDN homographs, redirects, `..` traversal,
DNS rebinding) is exactly the kind of thing that looks correct and is not. Here
there is nothing to validate: the request URL is a string copied verbatim out of
a file on disk, chosen by index.

Consequences worth stating:
  * The system can never fetch a page nobody put in the file.
  * A prompt injection can never cause a fetch, because injected text is not
    consulted for URL selection.
  * Adding a source is a file edit and a restart — deliberate and reviewable.

# WHERE THE LIST LIVES, AND WHY IT MOVED.
#
# It used to be web_agent/urls_allowlist.json, one of three separate places a
# new college had to edit (the others being frontend/src/institute.js and .env).
# It is now a section of config/institution.json — the single file a college
# fills in — so that deploying for a new institution is one file, not a hunt.
#
# NOTHING ABOUT THE SECURITY MODEL CHANGED. The same _validate() runs on the
# same fields, the model still never sees this list and still never supplies a
# URL, and selection is still deterministic keyword matching. Only the bytes'
# location moved.
#
# The legacy path is still read when the new one has no web_sources section, so
# an existing deployment keeps working across the upgrade without an edit.
