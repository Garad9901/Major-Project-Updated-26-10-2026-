# DRF's @api_view marks every view csrf_exempt and then relies on

# authentication_classes([]) — because login must work before a session exists —
# which meant NOTHING enforced CSRF on it. Verified exploitable: a POST with no
# CSRF token and Referer: https://evil.test/ returned HTTP 200 and a valid
# session cookie.
#
# That is login CSRF. An attacker cannot read anything with it directly, but
# they can silently sign a victim's browser into the ATTACKER'S account; the
# victim then asks questions believing the session is theirs, and every question
# and answer is written to the attacker's conversation history for them to read
# later. On a system answering questions about student records that is a
# confidentiality breach, not a nuisance.
#
# The fix is CSRFEnforcingAuthentication (see accounts/authentication.py for why
# the two obvious alternatives — @csrf_protect on the view, and csrf_protect() in
# urls.py — both fail, the second SILENTLY). It authenticates nobody; it only
# runs DRF's CSRF check before the view body.
