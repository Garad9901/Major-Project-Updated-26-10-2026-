#   sessions       were in Postgres. See SESSION_ENGINE below for why that was
#                  a resilience problem serious enough to add a service for.
#   login lockout  was a row update in Postgres on every failed attempt, so a
#                  password-guessing burst wrote to the records database.
#   DRF throttles  had NO cache configured, so they silently used LocMemCache —
#                  per PROCESS. That is correct today only because production
#                  runs one gunicorn worker; a second worker would have doubled
#                  every published rate limit without anyone noticing. Now the

# setUp, which is FLUSHDB. Running the suite against a live deployment would
# therefore sign out every user, drop every lockout and reset every rate limit,
# with no error and nothing in a log to explain it.
#
# Redis numbers its databases; index 1 is a completely separate keyspace from
# index 0, and FLUSHDB only affects the one selected. Switching indices under
# test makes the destructive operation harmless.
#
# `sys.argv` is an ugly way to detect a test run and is used anyway: the check
# has to happen at settings-import time, before Django has told anyone a test

# --- where sessions live ---------------------------------------------------------
# WAS django.contrib.sessions.backends.db, AND THAT WAS A REAL OUTAGE SHAPE.
#
# With database-backed sessions, Postgres is a hard dependency of
# AUTHENTICATION, not merely of answering. Resilience testing showed what that
# costs: with Postgres stopped, `POST /api/auth/login/` returned HTTP 500 and
# every request from an already-signed-in user failed on session lookup. The
# orchestrator has a careful degradation path — database down, answer from the
# vector store, tell the user the records lookup is unavailable — and it works,
# and it was unreachable, because nobody could hold a session to reach it.
#
# Cache-backed sessions move "who is signed in" to Redis, so that path is now
# reachable by real users. See docs/RESILIENCE.md for the measured before/after.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, deliberately: logging IN still needs Postgres, because
# the password hash and the user row live there. A NEW sign-in during a database
# outage fails, and should — it is not a resilience gap, it is credential
# verification being unavailable. It now fails with a clean 503 instead of a 500.
#
# THE TRADE: Redis is now a hard dependency of sessions. That is a smaller
# exposure than Postgres was — Redis does one simple thing, holds no queries,
# and is not the component that falls over under a heavy report — but it is not
# zero, which is why it runs with restart:always and AOF persistence.
# Django's own cache backend, with ONE behaviour changed: it does not treat an
# unreachable Redis as "this visitor is not signed in". The stock version
# swallows every exception in load(), so a Redis outage returned 403 to a
# signed-in user — telling them their account was the problem when the service
# was. See config/session_store.py.
SESSION_ENGINE = "config.session_store"

# USER: AuthenticationMiddleware still does `SELECT ... FROM auth_user` on every
# request, so an already-signed-in user was still getting a 500 during a
# database outage — measured, after the session change. This backend consults
# the database first and falls back to a cached identity only when it raises.
# See accounts/identity.py for the security reasoning.

# --- session timeout ----------------------------------------------------------
# Log a user out after this long with NO activity. 30 minutes by default.
#
# These two settings only do the right thing TOGETHER, and either alone is a
# trap:
#
#   SESSION_COOKIE_AGE alone           -> a HARD cap. The user is thrown out
#                                         30 minutes after LOGGING IN even if
#                                         they are actively using the system,
#                                         which on a stack where one answer can
#                                         take two minutes is a real risk of
