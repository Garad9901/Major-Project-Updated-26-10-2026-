"""Refuses to let production start on example, default or known-burned secrets.

WHY THIS RUNS AT SETTINGS-IMPORT TIME
Django's system-check framework is the tidy place for validation like this, but
it is not sufficient on its own: gunicorn loads config.wsgi directly and does
NOT run system checks. A check-only guard would therefore be silently skipped by
the very process that serves production traffic. So the authoritative call is
made from settings/production.py at import time, which every process performs.
The same logic is additionally exposed as a system check (see `register_checks`)
so `manage.py check` reports it in the normal way, which the Phase 7
verification script relies on.

WHY SOME VALUES ARE MATCHED BY HASH
Known-bad values fall into two kinds:

  * Published placeholders (`postgres`, `staffpass123`, ...). These already
    appear in .env.example in this repository, so naming them again here reveals
    nothing new and keeps the code readable.

  * Credentials that were genuinely configured at some point — specifically the
    rag_agent_ro password that was previously hard-coded in
    db/sql/create_rag_agent_ro.sql. Writing that back into the repository as a
    literal would re-introduce the exact exposure that was cleaned up. It is
    matched by SHA-256 instead: the guard can still recognise it, but the value
    is not recoverable from this file.

A hash is not a secret. The reverse is not true, which is the whole point.
