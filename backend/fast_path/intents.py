"""Question families answered without a language model.

WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND SQL AGENT

The SQL agent asks a model to WRITE a query, then validates it with the guard
because the model is untrusted. Nothing here writes SQL. Every statement is a
literal in this file, and the only thing the question contributes is a VALUE,
bound as a parameter by the driver.

That difference is the whole security argument:

  * a wrong match produces the wrong ANSWER TO A QUESTION, never a different
    query shape, never a different table, never a second statement
  * the guard's job — "is this SQL safe to run" — cannot fail here because the
    SQL was written by hand and reviewed
  * values are never string-formatted into SQL, so there is nothing to inject
    into

The one thing that IS attacker-influenced is which of these fixed statements
runs and with what value, and both are constrained: the intent must match a
pattern, and the value must already exist in the database's own vocabulary.

WHY EVERY FAMILY IS A COUNT OR AN AVERAGE

Because those have exactly one correct answer that can be rendered without
judgement. "Describe the development profile of Engineering" does not — it needs
prose, and prose is what the model is for. Attempting it here would mean writing
a template that summarises, which is the same act of generation with none of the
model's flexibility and all of its risk of saying something the data does not
support.

Anything not listed here falls through to the model. That is the correct
default, and it is why this file is allowed to be conservative.

# Patterns
#
# Written to match how people ACTUALLY ask, taken from the audit log rather than
# imagined. The real traffic contains all of:
#
#     How many faculty are in the Computer Science department?
#     How many faculty records are there for the Science department?
#     How Many Faculty members are there in CSE Department
#     How many faculty hold the rank of Professor?
#     How many faculty have Expert competency level?
#     How many faculty are from Public universities?
#
# so the patterns are deliberately loose about the words BETWEEN the anchors and
# strict about the anchors themselves. A pattern that matches too eagerly is not
# a safety problem — it is a wrong answer, which is worse — so each one requires
# a counting verb AND a subject AND a value found in the database vocabulary.
