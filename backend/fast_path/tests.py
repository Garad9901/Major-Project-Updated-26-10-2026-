"""The fast path must be right or absent — never approximately right.

It answers without a language model and without the verifier, so nothing
downstream can catch a mistake it makes. Every test here is therefore about one
of two properties:

  1. when it answers, the answer is correct
  2. when it is not certain, it returns None and the normal pipeline runs

Property 2 is the one that carries the risk. A fast path that answers 95%
correctly is worse than one that answers 60% and declines the rest, because the
5% arrive as confident wrong figures with no model and no verifier between them
and the reader.
