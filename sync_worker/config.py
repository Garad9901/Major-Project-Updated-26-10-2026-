# ==============================================================================
# WHICH TABLES TO POLL — discovered, not hard-coded
# ==============================================================================
# This module used to carry its own copy of the table allowlist: the third of
# three copies. The other two (the backend's setup_readonly_role command and
# sql_agent/schema.py) now share backend/common/allowlist.py.
#
# This worker CANNOT import that module — it runs in a separate container with
# its own build context, and no Python path reaches backend code from here.
#
# So rather than becoming a fourth copy, it asks the DATABASE what it may read.
# That is strictly stronger than importing a list: an imported list can drift
# from the grants actually in force, whereas this worker literally cannot poll a
# table Postgres has not granted it. The chain is:
#
#     common/allowlist.py  ->  setup_readonly_role  ->  Postgres grants  ->  here
#
# THE EXPLICIT EXCLUSION
# `courses_prerequisites` is granted to this role but must NOT be polled. It is
# a bare many-to-many join table (course_id, prerequisite_id) with no
# `updated_at` column, and change detection here rests entirely on comparing
# `updated_at` watermarks — polling it would raise UndefinedColumn every cycle.
# It stays granted because the SQL agent must JOIN through it to answer "what
# are the prerequisites for X".
#
# That exclusion is both enforced structurally (no watermark column -> cannot be
# polled) AND named below, so it is a documented decision rather than a silent
# side effect of the query. If the excluded set ever stops matching
# EXPECTED_EXCLUSIONS the worker says so loudly at startup, instead of quietly
# polling — or quietly skipping — something new.
# ==============================================================================

# The watermark column every pollable table must have.
WATERMARK_COLUMN = "updated_at"

# Documented, expected exclusions. This is an assertion aid only: changing it
# does not change behaviour, it changes whether the worker warns you.
#
#   courses_prerequisites
#       A bare many-to-many join table (course_id, prerequisite_id) with no
#       updated_at of its own. See the note above.
#
#   faculty_development
#       The imported 13,000-row survey snapshot. Deliberately built without an
#       updated_at column (see academics/models.FacultyDevelopment) so it is
#       excluded structurally rather than by a flag. It is bulk-loaded, static
#       between loads, and entirely numeric/categorical — polling it would queue
#       13,000 change events and embedding it would be 13,000 embedding calls
#       over rows containing no prose. Semantic search over that data is served
#       instead by faculty_development_profiles, which IS polled and embedded.

#
# Intersected with the discovered poll list at runtime, so naming a table here
# that turns out not to be readable is harmless rather than a crash.

# not authored; see academics/models.FacultyDevelopmentProfile for exactly what
