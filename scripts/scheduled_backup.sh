# THE BACKUP THAT RUNS WITHOUT ANYONE REMEMBERING TO SCHEDULE IT.
#
# scripts/backup.sh is the operator's manual tool and stays exactly as it is.
# This is the unattended one, run by the `backup` service in docker-compose.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
# The documented procedure was "add this line to crontab". The production audit
# then found that the entry had never actually been installed, and
# verify_deployment.sh has been failing on "most recent backup is older than 2
# days" ever since. That is the whole problem with a documented manual step: it
# is indistinguishable, from the outside, from a forgotten one. A product a
# stranger installs cannot depend on them remembering.
#
# WHY IT DOES NOT MOUNT THE DOCKER SOCKET
# scripts/backup.sh shells out to `docker compose exec postgres pg_dump`. Doing
# that from inside a container needs /var/run/docker.sock, and mounting the
# docker socket into a long-running service is equivalent to giving it root on
# the host — a serious privilege escalation to accept in exchange for a cron
# replacement. So this connects to Postgres over the internal network with
# pg_dump instead, and to Qdrant over its HTTP API. It needs no privilege beyond
# reaching two services it already shares a network with.
#
# WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO
# Copy anything off this machine. A backup on the same disk as the database does
# not survive that disk failing, which is the most likely thing it needs to
# survive. Shipping archives off-box remains an operator decision — see
# DEPLOYMENT.md — because where they should go is a question only the
# institution can answer.
