-- Read-only Postgres role for the RAG agent.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES:
--   - Creates (or resets the flags on) a login role `rag_agent_ro` that:
--       * cannot create databases, roles, or replicate
--       * defaults every session to a read-only transaction (defense in depth,
--         on top of the grants below — belt and suspenders)
--       * has USAGE on the `public` schema but no privileges on any table
--         until explicitly granted below
--       * gets SELECT on the whitelisted tables ONLY — nothing else, no
--         wildcard grants, no future-table auto-grants
--
-- YOU DO NOT NORMALLY NEED TO RUN THIS. The backend applies exactly these
-- statements on every startup via `manage.py setup_readonly_role` (see
-- backend/academics/management/commands/setup_readonly_role.py), reading the
-- password from RAG_AGENT_RO_PASSWORD in .env. This file is the reference
-- copy / manual fallback.
--
-- NO PASSWORD IS WRITTEN IN THIS FILE, deliberately — the secret lives only in
-- .env (which is gitignored). The password is passed in as a psql variable.
--
-- HOW TO RUN MANUALLY (from the repo root, with the stack up):
--   docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres -d college_rag \
--     -v pw="$RAG_AGENT_RO_PASSWORD" -f - < db/sql/create_rag_agent_ro.sql
--
-- Never replace :'pw' below with a literal password — that would put a live
-- secret into a file that gets copied, committed, and shared.
-- ============================================================================

-- Create only if missing. Done with psql's \if rather than a DO $$ block
-- because psql does NOT interpolate :'pw' inside dollar-quoted strings — the
-- variable would be sent to the server verbatim and fail.

    -- RAISED FROM 10 TO 32, together with GUNICORN_THREADS (4 -> 24) and
    -- RAG_AGENT_RO_POOL_MAX (8 -> 24). Raising any one alone only moves where
    -- the failure happens.
    --
    -- Budget: 24 for the backend's connection pool, 1 held continuously by the
    -- sync worker, and headroom for an operator running check_rag_agent_ro
    -- while the system is busy.
    --
    -- Still a HARD CEILING rather than unlimited, deliberately. It is what
    -- turns runaway connection use into a clear refusal naming this role,
    -- instead of exhausting the server's global max_connections and taking
    -- down every other client with it.

-- Lock down the schema itself: PUBLIC (i.e. every role, by default) loses

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- General institutional data ONLY — no per-student records. The agent's job
-- is general Q&A (courses offered, departments, faculty, timetable, fee
-- structure), not lookups tied to an individual student's identity.
--
-- Deliberately EXCLUDED (per-student / sensitive — see backend/academics/models.py):
--   students, enrollments, attendance, exam_results, fee_payments
-- Also excluded: Django's own auth_*/django_* tables (not college data at all).
